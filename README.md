# Make executable
chmod +x index.ts

# Build (optional)
bun run build
```

## Setup

### 1. API Configuration

Set up your Grok API key:

```bash
# Interactive setup
bun run setup
```

Or manually configure via config command.

### 2. Global Installation (Optional)

```bash
# Build and install globally
bun run prepublishOnly  # Creates executable at ./index.ts
# Then symlink or add to PATH as needed
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Interactive agent selector
grok-code

# List available conceptual agents
grok-code list

# Start chat with specific agent
grok-code chat orchestrator
grok-code chat coder --auto

# Configure agents
grok-code config
```

### Code Generation

```bash
# Generate code
grok-code generate "javascript" "Create a user authentication system"

# With requirements and constraints
grok-code generate "python" "Build a REST API" \
  --requirements "JWT auth, rate limiting" \
  --constraints "FastAPI, PostgreSQL" \
  --context "E-commerce application"

# Stream generation
grok-code stream-generate "react" "Build a dashboard component"
```

### Code Analysis & Tools

```bash
# Analyze code
grok-code analyze "$(cat myfile.js)" --type performance
grok-code analyze "$(cat myfile.js)" javascript --type security

# Code completion
grok-code complete "function greet" --suffix ")" --language javascript
grok-code complete "#include <iostream>" --language cpp
```

### Pipeline Orchestration

```bash
# List available pipelines
grok-code pipelines

# Run code development pipeline
grok-code pipeline code-development "Add user authentication to existing codebase"

# Memory-enhanced pipeline (with learning)
grok-code pipeline-memory code-development "Implement real-time notifications"

# Intelligent orchestration (auto-agent selection)
grok-code orchestrate "Debug why my app crashes on startup"

# Analyze optimal workflow without execution
grok-code auto-analyze "Optimize database queries for better performance"
```

### Memory Management

```bash
# Analyze memories for pipeline optimization
grok-code memory-analyze code-development "Enhance the existing API endpoints"

# Clear all stored memories (factory reset)
grok-code forget-memories --force
```

### Benchmarking & Testing

```bash
# Benchmark Grok Code Fast-1 performance
grok-code benchmark --iterations 10
```
